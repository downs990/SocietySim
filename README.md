# SocietySim

The purpose of this simulation is to model a society with specified environmental characteristics and common personality traits that can be affected by the type of environment and other people that one interacts with frequently. 

The long term objective for this project is to configure an environment with a desired society and observe how that society evolves over multiple generations and develop unique traits based on random historic events. 

**Modes**
- Interactive (Adjust or view individual people and historic events at run time)
- Autopilot (Set number of years to run and view data in post)
 

**Skills Learned**
- Basic Simulation Design  
- Object-oriented Java 
- Multi-threaded processes 
- Custom data structures
